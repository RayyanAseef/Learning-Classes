# My Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Classes
When I first delved into object-oriented programming with classes, I decided to tackle a challenging project: creating the classic snake game using NetBeans JavaScript. I worked on this project for a month and collaborated with senior programmers to ensure the game was functional and running smoothly. Although it was a stressful project, I had a lot of fun building it.

Looking back, I realize that this project laid the foundation for the object-oriented programming I do today. At the beginning, I was confused about when to choose functions over classes. However, with the guidance of my seniors and my high school computer science teacher, I learned a lot while working on this project.

It was a valuable experience that taught me the importance of collaboration and seeking guidance from experienced programmers. Today, I continue to build upon the foundation that the snake game project provided, and I look forward to tackling even more challenging projects in the future.
